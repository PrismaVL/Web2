        <div id="intro-div"> In replacement of MK3, Toyota launched the Supra MK4 in 1993 with a more aerodynamic design. The new Supra had been in development for 4 years and was Toyota’s direct answer to the performance rivals offered by Mazda’s RX7 Turbo and Nissan’s 300ZX. </div>
        <div id="intro-div2"> The MK4’s engine has become quite a legend as it’s offered in both naturally aspirated or twin-turbo forms. The 3-litre straight-six has 4 valves per cylinder, features sequential electronic fuel injection, an aluminum head, and a cast-iron block. The twin-turbo cars were fitted with an all-new 6-speed manual gearbox, whereas the naturally aspirated models had the W58 5 speed unit. Each model was also offered with a 4-speed automatic that featured a manual shift mode.</div>
        <div id="intro-div3">Toyota used aluminium for the hood, suspension arms, and transmission pans. Compared to the previous model, the MK4 was shorter, lower and wider, and 100kg lighter. Therefore, the car community quickly embraced the MK4 with numerous body tweaks.</div>
